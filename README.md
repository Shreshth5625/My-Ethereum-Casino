# Ethereum Casino DApp

## 

In this project, I have created a **Casino DApp** where users can bet money for a number between 1 and 10 and if they’re lucky enough, they win a portion of all the ether money staked after 100 total bets.

### Technology used :
- [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/) - Offers a javascript framework for building smart contracts in Solidity.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Frontend UI
- [web3js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) - Offers interaction between JS and Ethereum
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Asset bundler for JS and CSS
- [Contract’s programing language](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.11/index.html): Solidity 0.5.0
- [Development server](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/): Node.js to use the app while developing locally along with testrpc.
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/): To use the final application like the end user would.

### Project Setup
1. Clone this repo via the terminal by running "git clone https://github.com/Shreshth5625/My-Ethereum-Casino.git"
3. Go to the project's client directory and run "npm install" to setup the project's dependencies.
5. In the root directory, run ganache-cli or ganache-GUI, and connect on a local development server with the contract and migrate. 
6. Go to the client directory in terminal and run command "**npm run start**".


The Dapp is good to go !
